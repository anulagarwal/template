While using the asset, make sure you drag desired prefab from “Prefabs” folder right on the scene. If the character has the wrong scale for your game, please, change the x and y scale.

Notice: if you see gray lines in the characters - it means that Color Space must be set to Gamma. Please, do the following steps:
Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Rendering > Color Space to Gamma
